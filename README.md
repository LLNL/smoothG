Mixed graph-Laplacian upscaling and solvers.

For installation instructions, see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

For a tutorial walkthrough of the example code, see [EXAMPLE.md](doc/EXAMPLE.md).

This project is intended to take a graph and build a smaller (upscaled)
graph that is representative of the original in some way. We represent
the graph Laplacian in a mixed form, solve some local eigenvalue problems
to uncover near-nullspace modes, and use those modes as coarse degrees
of freedom.

This code is based largely on the following paper:

> A.T. Barker, C.S. Lee, and P.S. Vassilevski, Spectral upscaling for 
> graph Laplacian problems with application to reservoir simulation, *SIAM
> J. Sci. Comput.*, Vol. 39, No. 5, pp. S323â€“S346.

This code has contributions from:
